# TrueTH
Fine-tuned TH soma identification pipeline.

## Installation
Before running this workflow, you need to install QuPath and Cellpose:
1. Install QuPath 0.5.0 following: https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases/tag/v0.5.0
2. Install Cellpose and QuPath-extension-cellpose followingï¼šhttps://github.com/BIOP/qupath-extension-cellpose
3. Add the TrueTH model path to "[text](script/IHC_DAB_channel_auto_detect.groovy)"and "[text](script/IF_red_channel_detection.groovy)"scripts

## Getting started
To execute entire workflow, available scripts must be executed in following order:
1. Open QuPath, create a project, add your images and set the image type to H-DAB or Fluorescence. Creat the annotation for the region you want to analysis, such as SNc.

2. Preform cell detection:
Run the "[text](script/IHC_DAB_channel_auto_detect.groovy)" for IHC images or "[text](script/IF_red_channel_detection.groovy)" for florescence images, the script also can use the 'run for project' button to execute batch processing.

3. Add detection intensity measurements:
Run "[text](<script/Add full intensity measurements to detection.groovy>)" to add intensity measurements for every channel,the script can use 'run for project' button to execute batch processing.

4. Postprocess:
Run "[text](<script/Cell filter.groovy>)" for cell filter, this step filter out the small false detection and black artifacts, use 'run for project' button to execute batch processing.

5. For cell counts and detection intensity data:
Run "[text](<script/export cell counts detection.groovy>)" to export the cell counts and measurements in all images.
6. For cell binary image:
Run "[text](<script/export binary image.groovy>)" to export the cell detection binaray images, use 'run for project' button to execute batch processing.
The results are stored in the 'detection' directory in the QuPath project directory.
